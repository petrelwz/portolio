                            <p>Atos is an IT service company that provide various IT solutions to its clients. Atos OneSource is a mobile platform to provide client CTO / CIO and personnel with other managerial roles with consolidated information of Atos service in the forms of dashboards, reports, timelines and live feed. The company goal of building OneSource is to increase client retention by providing an added value product, to increase client exposure of Atos offerings and to increase internal operational efficiency through data / insights. </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic">To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Atos.</p>

                            <!-- Project Goal -->
                            <h4>My Role</h4>
                            <p>I design for Atos OneSource across iOS and Android since Nov 2016. My goal is to improve the existing user experience. I led the design to address customer pain‐points related to navigation, functionality discovery and design where should marketing material go. As the only designer in the team, I worked closely with project managers and developers in launching new feature to achieve business goals of the product.</p>
                            <h4>Research & Scope</h4>
                            <p>OneSource is a product that is rather complex in nature. It deals a complex user group with unique business and technical knowledge. I started by interviewing with 15 people with different roles within Atos to understand the tool from a broader business perspective and context of usage, which helped me to further define the scope of my design.</p>
                            <p>After getting feedback from account team who work closely with customers on a daily basis and Atos personnel who manage or indirectly work with the the account team, I identify the following challenges I would face in this design process.</p>
                            <img src="img/onesource/insights.png" class="img-responsive img-centered big-image"alt="">
                            <p>Because the product is already in use, there is legacy issue I also have to consider. The product owner doesn’t want too big changes within the app. Then me and the product owner discussed and defined among my suggested changes which would be “Design quick-wins” that can be implemented in the short term and which will be “implemented step by step” in the long term.</p>
                            <!-- User Research -->
                            <h4>Usability testing & Feedback gathering</h4>
                            <p>Clients, especially higher executive client are very difficult to arrange meeting with. They are too busy to run the usability tests.The account team helped me in setting a first round usability testing with 6 users including 1 higher level manager, 3 mid-management users and 2 technical managers.</p>
